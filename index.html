    <p>
      I think the black box has some sort of tubing system managing the intake water and determining the output of that water.
    </p>
                                                                                                     <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p> The black box is an unknown object that has a funnel at the top and a tube at the bottom. I don't know how the box operates but that's what I'm trying to figure out. My initial observations was when you pour water in, sometimes none comes out and sometimes more or less may come out. The initial trial 500 mL of water was poured in and 0 mL came out. My approach of figuring out how it works was making my own model and comparing it to my own. My model's key structures were made of tubing and bowls connected to that tubing. The tube's job was to transfer water from the funnel to a bowl out the bottom of the bowl into another bowl and out through the tubing connected to that. I tested my model similar to the original black box by pouring a measured amount of water in my model of the box. My first trial I poured in 100 mL and just like the original box 0 mL came out.</p>
                                                                                                   <h1>Reasoning Pt.1</h1>
  <p>A model is designed to show what you may have imagined or something you would like for someone else to imagine. The model shows how it works or what it may help do or a specific thing the creator may want it to do. 
    </p>
    <h1>Reasoning Pt.2</h1>
    <p>My evidence supports my claim because as I explained in the evidence when water is poured in none may come out and sometimes more or less comes out. This supports my claim because my claim was “I think the black box has some sort of tubing system managing the intake water and determining the output of that water.” Therefore giving me a reasonable idea to have the claim that I do. 
    </p>
    <h1>Reasoning Pt.3</h1>  
    <p>The data would’ve been different if the box didn't have a sort of tubing system because if it worked differently then they wouldn't have the same outcome thus proving an alternative claim makes the data different.
